# College Inquiry Chatbot Capstone project

## Description
A college inquiry chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to assist prospective students, current students, and alumni with their inquiries about a college or university. This chatbot can be integrated into the college's website or mobile application to provide users with a personalized and interactive experience.

The chatbot is programmed to answer frequently asked questions about the college's admission process, programs, campus life, and other related information. It can also provide users with links to additional resources, such as the college's website or social media pages.
